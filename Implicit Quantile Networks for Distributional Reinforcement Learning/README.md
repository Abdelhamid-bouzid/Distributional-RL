# Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Quantile Regression
A Distributional Perspective on Reinforcement Learning

This folder contains an implemation of "Implicit Quantile Networks for Distributional Reinforcement Learning". 
This the link of paper "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06923.pdf"

Just the evaluation part is diffrent from the paper.
